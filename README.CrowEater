This is my fork of the Doom3 code.

The aim is to build a version of Doom3 for OSX 10.8, there are probably better versions of Doom3 for you to run on OSX, this is mostly for my own benifit to learn a little about OSX/XCode.

I have had a working build for a while now, always intending to make more modifications, but since 10.9 is nearly upon us and I haven't had time to work on this I thought I'd just release what I have.
